### 📜 Problem Description

Given a 2D grid  **mat[][]**  of size **n × m**  consisting of characters and a string  **word** , find all starting positions where the word occurs in the grid.

- The word can be formed from any cell by moving in any of the 8 directions (2 horizontal, 2 vertical, and 4 diagonal) in a straight line without changing direction.

- Each cell can be used at most once per occurrence.

- Return all unique starting coordinates in lexicographically smallest order.

**Examples :**

```
Input: mat[][] = {{a,b,a,b},{a,b,e,b},{e,b,e,b}}, word = "abe"
Output: {{0,0}, {0,2}, {1,0}}
Explanation: From (0,0) we can find "abe" in right-down diagonal. From (0,2) we can find "abe" in left-down diagonal. From (1,0) we can find "abe" in horizontally right direction.

```

```
Input: mat[][] = {{G,E,E,K,S,F,O,R,G,E,E,K,S}, {G,E,E,K,S,Q,U,I,Z,G,E,E,K}, {I,D,E,Q,A,P,R,A,C,T,I,C,E}}, word = "GEEKS"
Output: {{0,0}, {0,8}, {1,0}}
Explanation: From (0,0) we can find "GEEKS" horizontally right. From (0,8) we can find "GEEKS" horizontally right. From (1,0) we can find "GEEKS" horizontally right. 

```

**Constraints:** 
1 <= n <= m <= 50
1 <= |word| <= 20
